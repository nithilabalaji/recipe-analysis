# Predicting how long a recipe takes to complete
by Nithila Balaji

# Introduction

This project is part of DSC 80 at UCSD, focusing on analyzing data from Food.com, a popular recipe-sharing website. The dataset includes detailed information about recipes and user interactions such as ratings and reviews. The primary objective is to investigate how the cooking time of a recipe influences user ratings.

Understanding the relationship between cooking time and user ratings is valuable for several reasons:
1. For Home Cooks: Knowing which recipes are more likely to be highly rated can help home cooks make better choices based on the time they have available.
2. For Recipe Developers: Insights from this analysis can guide recipe developers in optimizing their recipes to cater to user preferences, potentially increasing their popularity and user satisfaction.
3. For Food Enthusiasts: It sheds light on broader trends in cooking and food preferences, contributing to the general knowledge about how time investment correlates with culinary satisfaction.

The original dataset has 83782 rows and 13 columns. We will go further into the relevant columns in the next section.
